						The Raven

Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten loreâ€”
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
â€œâ€™Tis some visitor,â€ I muttered, â€œtapping at my chamber doorâ€”
            Only this and nothing more.â€

    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December;
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
    Eagerly I wished the morrow;â€”vainly I had sought to borrow
    From my books surcease of sorrowâ€”sorrow for the lost Lenoreâ€”
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenoreâ€”
            Nameless here for evermore.

    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
Thrilled meâ€”filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
    â€œâ€™Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber doorâ€”
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;â€”
            This it is and nothing more.â€

    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,
â€œSir,â€ said I, â€œor Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;
    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
That I scarce was sure I heard youâ€â€”here I opened wide the door;â€”
            Darkness there and nothing more.

    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, â€œLenore?â€
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, â€œLenore!â€â€”
            Merely this and nothing more.

    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
    â€œSurely,â€ said I, â€œsurely that is something at my window lattice;
      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery exploreâ€”
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;â€”
            â€™Tis the wind and nothing more!â€

    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;
    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;
    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber doorâ€”
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber doorâ€”
            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.

Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
â€œThough thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,â€ I said, â€œart sure no craven,
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shoreâ€”
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Nightâ€™s Plutonian shore!â€
            Quoth the Raven â€œNevermore.â€

    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
Though its answer little meaningâ€”little relevancy bore;
    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber doorâ€”
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
            With such name as â€œNevermore.â€

    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
    Nothing farther then he utteredâ€”not a feather then he flutteredâ€”
    Till I scarcely more than muttered â€œOther friends have flown beforeâ€”
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.â€
            Then the bird said â€œNevermore.â€

    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
â€œDoubtless,â€ said I, â€œwhat it utters is its only stock and store
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden boreâ€”
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
            Of â€˜Neverâ€”nevermoreâ€™.â€

    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;
    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yoreâ€”
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
            Meant in croaking â€œNevermore.â€

    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosomâ€™s core;
    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
    On the cushionâ€™s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated oâ€™er,
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating oâ€™er,
            She shall press, ah, nevermore!

    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
    â€œWretch,â€ I cried, â€œthy God hath lent theeâ€”by these angels he hath sent thee
    Respiteâ€”respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!â€
            Quoth the Raven â€œNevermore.â€

    â€œProphet!â€ said I, â€œthing of evil!â€”prophet still, if bird or devil!â€”
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchantedâ€”
    On this home by Horror hauntedâ€”tell me truly, I imploreâ€”
Is thereâ€”is there balm in Gilead?â€”tell meâ€”tell me, I implore!â€
            Quoth the Raven â€œNevermore.â€

    â€œProphet!â€ said I, â€œthing of evil!â€”prophet still, if bird or devil!
By that Heaven that bends above usâ€”by that God we both adoreâ€”
    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenoreâ€”
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.â€
            Quoth the Raven â€œNevermore.â€

    â€œBe that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!â€ I shrieked, upstartingâ€”
â€œGet thee back into the tempest and the Nightâ€™s Plutonian shore!
    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
    Leave my loneliness unbroken!â€”quit the bust above my door!
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!â€
            Quoth the Raven â€œNevermore.â€

    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door;
    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demonâ€™s that is dreaming,
    And the lamp-light oâ€™er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor;
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
            Shall be liftedâ€”nevermore!
